	<h1>403 Forbidden - Cause: Falling off the edge</h1>
	<div>
		<h3>I've noticed that you're falling off the edge, would you like help with that?</h3>
		<p>
			Anyway, due to the fact that you're using a browser by Micro$oft, I can't
			let you access this website. Please change to
			<big><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/">Firefox</a></big> or
			another non-shitty browser.<br>

				Following browsers are ones that I don't like, but they're still far
				superior to Edge: <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a>,
				<a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>
